# Rhetorical Triangle Assessment

Evaluate and improve persuasive communication through the three modes of persuasion: ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), and logos (logic).

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How do I make this more persuasive?"
- Request to review an argument, pitch, presentation, or proposal
- User asks "Why isn't this convincing?"
- Need to communicate effectively to a resistant or skeptical audience
- User wants to improve their communication or influence
- Analyzing why a message succeeded or failed
- Preparing for high-stakes communication

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| content | Yes | The argument, pitch, presentation, or communication to analyze |
| audience | No | Who the communication is intended for (affects weight of each mode) |
| purpose | No | What outcome the communication is meant to achieve |
| context | No | Situation in which communication will occur |

## The Three Modes of Persuasion

### Ethos (Credibility)

**Definition:** Persuasion through the character and credibility of the speaker.

**Questions to evaluate:**
- Why should the audience trust this speaker?
- What establishes the speaker's authority on this topic?
- Does the speaker demonstrate good character, goodwill, and practical wisdom?
- Is the speaker's reputation working for or against the message?
- Does the communication itself demonstrate competence?

**Sources of ethos:**
- Expertise and credentials
- Demonstrated experience
- Shared values with audience
- Reputation and track record
- Quality of preparation and delivery
- Evidence of understanding the audience

**Common ethos failures:**
- Assuming audience grants credibility automatically
- Leading with credentials without demonstrating relevance
- Actions inconsistent with stated values
- Obvious self-interest undermining trust
- Technical errors that undermine perceived competence

### Pathos (Emotional Appeal)

**Definition:** Persuasion through appealing to the audience's emotions, values, and beliefs.

**Questions to evaluate:**
- Does this connect to what the audience cares about?
- What emotions does this evoke (or fail to evoke)?
- Are values and beliefs engaged, or only intellect?
- Is there urgency, importance, or significance conveyed?
- Can the audience see themselves in this?

**Elements of effective pathos:**
- Stories and concrete examples
- Vivid language and imagery
- Connection to audience's existing values
- Appropriate emotional intensity
- Stakes made real and tangible
- Human faces on abstract issues

**Common pathos failures:**
- Pure data without human connection
- Emotional manipulation that feels inauthentic
- Misreading what the audience values
- Excessive emotion that overwhelms logic
- No answer to "why should I care?"

### Logos (Logical Argument)

**Definition:** Persuasion through logical reasoning, evidence, and structured argument.

**Questions to evaluate:**
- Is the argument structure clear and valid?
- Is evidence relevant, sufficient, and credible?
- Are claims supported or merely asserted?
- Are counterarguments addressed?
- Does the conclusion follow from the premises?

**Elements of effective logos:**
- Clear thesis or main claim
- Valid argument structure
- Relevant and credible evidence
- Acknowledgment of limitations
- Anticipation of objections
- Logical transitions between points

**Common logos failures:**
- Unsupported assertions
- Logical fallacies (strawman, false dilemma, etc.)
- Evidence that doesn't match claims
- Ignoring counterarguments
- Conclusion doesn't follow from argument
- Complexity that obscures rather than clarifies

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Assess Each Mode Independently
Rate the strength of each mode on a scale of 1-10 and identify specific strengths and weaknesses.

### Step 2: Evaluate Balance
Determine whether the three modes are in appropriate proportion for the audience and purpose:
- Technical audiences may weight logos higher
- Value-driven decisions may weight pathos higher
- Situations with trust deficits may require ethos emphasis
- Most effective communication balances all three

### Step 3: Identify the Weakest Link
The weakest mode often determines overall effectiveness—a brilliant logical argument fails if the speaker lacks credibility or the audience doesn't care.

### Step 4: Generate Specific Improvements
Provide actionable recommendations to strengthen each mode, prioritizing the weakest.

## Audience-Mode Matrix

| Audience Type | Ethos Weight | Pathos Weight | Logos Weight |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Technical/Expert | Medium | Low | High |
| Executive/Decision-maker | High | Medium | Medium |
| General Public | Medium | High | Medium |
| Skeptical/Hostile | Very High | Low | High |
| Supportive/Aligned | Low | High | Medium |
| Academic/Research | High | Low | Very High |
| Sales/Customer | Medium | High | Medium |

---

## Constraints

- All three modes matter—do not dismiss any
- Ethos is often underestimated in importance
- Pathos is not manipulation when authentic
- Logos alone rarely persuades on important matters
- The appropriate balance depends on audience and context
- Do not sacrifice one mode entirely to strengthen another

## Example

**Input:** "Review my pitch to the board for a new AI initiative: 'We should invest $2M in AI capabilities. McKinsey says 70% of companies will adopt AI by 2030. Our competitors are already moving. This will improve efficiency by 30% and position us for the future.'"

**Output:**

## Rhetorical Triangle Assessment

### Overview
**Content:** Pitch for $2M AI investment to board of directors
**Audience:** Board of directors (executives, likely skeptical of large expenditures)
**Purpose:** Secure approval for significant investment

### Ethos Assessment
**Strength:** 3/10

**Current State:**
- No establishment of why you are credible on AI
- Relies on McKinsey as external authority rather than internal expertise
- No demonstration of understanding the company's specific situation
- No evidence of having done the homework on this proposal

**Strengths:**
- References credible external source (McKinsey)

**Weaknesses:**
- You are invisible in this pitch—why should the board trust your judgment?
- No evidence of domain expertise or relevant experience
- No acknowledgment of risks or limitations (suggests naive optimism)
- Generic proposal could apply to any company

### Pathos Assessment
**Strength:** 4/10

**Current State:**
- Fear appeal (competitors moving) is present but weak
- No connection to company's values, mission, or identity
- No human stakes or stories
- "Position for the future" is abstract and uninspiring

**Strengths:**
- Competitive pressure creates some urgency

**Weaknesses:**
- No answer to "why should I care beyond fear?"
- No vision of what success looks like
- Numbers (30%, $2M) are bloodless without context
- Missing: What problem does this solve for people we care about?

### Logos Assessment
**Strength:** 5/10

**Current State:**
- Has claims (70% adoption, 30% efficiency) but weak argument structure
- No clear reasoning chain from investment to outcome
- Industry statistics don't prove this investment makes sense for us
- The 30% efficiency claim is unsupported—where does this come from?

**Strengths:**
- Includes specific numbers
- Mentions concrete outcome (efficiency)

**Weaknesses:**
- "Our competitors are moving" is not evidence we should
- Logical gap: McKinsey stat about adoption doesn't justify $2M
- No business case: What's the ROI? Timeline? Risk?
- No counterarguments addressed (why not wait? why not $500K?)

### Balance Assessment

| Mode | Strength | Appropriate Weight for This Audience |
|------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Ethos | 3/10 | High (board needs to trust proposer) |
| Pathos | 4/10 | Medium (decision is rational but values matter) |
| Logos | 5/10 | High (board expects rigorous analysis) |

**Overall Balance:** All three modes are weak. For a board audience, ethos and logos are critically underdeveloped.

**Weakest Link:** Ethos. The board has no reason to trust this recommendation. Even if the argument improved, "who is saying this and why should we believe them?" is unanswered.

### Recommendations

**Priority 1: Ethos**
- Open with your relevant experience or what work you've done to understand this
- Acknowledge what you don't know and how you'll address it
- Demonstrate you understand the board's concerns (cost, risk, distraction)
- Show this isn't naive enthusiasm—you've considered the downsides

**Priority 2: Logos**
- Build a real business case: specific costs, specific benefits, timeline, milestones
- Don't just cite industry stats—show analysis of our situation specifically
- Address obvious objections: "You might ask why not start smaller—here's why..."
- Connect the investment to measurable outcomes with accountability

**Priority 3: Pathos**
- Paint a picture of what we become with this capability
- Connect to company mission/values, not just efficiency
- One specific example of a problem this solves for a customer or employee

### Revised Opening

"Over the past six months, I've studied how AI is transforming our industry and analyzed where it could create value for us specifically—not in theory, but in practice. I've talked with three companies who've made similar investments and learned what worked and what didn't. What I'm proposing today is a phased $2M investment over 18 months that, based on detailed analysis I'll share, should improve our core process efficiency by 25-35% and position us to capture opportunities our competitors will miss. I'll also share the risks and how we'll manage them, because this isn't a guaranteed win—it's a calculated bet I believe we should make. Here's why..."

*Persuasion comes from the character of the speaker, the disposition of the audience, and the argument itself. Neglect any one, and the other two cannot compensate.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Aristotle** expert persona. Use it when communication needs to persuade, influence, or convince. It pairs well with:
- **first-principles-reasoning** to strengthen logos
- **golden-mean-analysis** to find the right balance of emotional intensity
- **four-causes-analysis** to ensure complete understanding before pitching
